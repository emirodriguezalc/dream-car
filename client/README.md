# Dream car

This website was created in one day, for the Hackday of Salt bootcamp.

I used two Apis, one to retrieve the cars information, and another one to get the images of each car.

I have an express server and a react front end.

In the main branch you can see the first iteration of the project. I improve and refactor the code in other branches.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the server

### `cd client npm start`

Launches the react application.
